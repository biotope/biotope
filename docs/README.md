# Biotope
Biotope, your friendly, neighbourhood __ecosystem framework__.

## What's that?
It is a framework which enables you to develop scalabale, platform-agnostic frontend component ecosystems.

## So it's an ecosystem?
No. An ecosystem is a pool of components which can be used in any combination to build your websites and/or web applications user interface. The same components can be used in 1-n projects.

An ecosystem framework on the other hand helps you building such an ecosystem and makes sure all components play well with each other, you get an overview over all components in the pool and information on how to use them.

## Now I got it.
Nice! Then you can start using biotope by either reading the quick start guide, or taking a deeper look in the documentation.
